==========
An AI experiment using SVG.

Can be played at http://www.andronikos.id.au

The game aspect is based on [Outwitters](http://onemanleft.com/category/outwitters/) which I used to have a lot of fun playing back when I had an iPhone.

The AI is totally governed by influence fields. It does a pretty good job fighting the player but it's somewhat directionless at the moment.
The AI won't attempt to attack the castle.
